Jacquie brings a unique goal-driven perspective to her clientele as a result of being a former four-time Academic All-American Division One golfer at UCLA prior to finishing her career at Northern Arizona University.  Setting high-performance goals has been a part of Jacquie's life, beginning at a very young age.  Her relentless work ethic and goal-driven personality not only rewarded her with great success on the golf course but in the classroom, where she earned a Bachelor's Degree in Journalism, graduating Magna Cum Laude.  After her undergraduate academic and athletic achievements, Jacquie attended the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law, earning her master's degree in Sports Law and Business.

Jacquie exhibits the focus and discipline of an elite athlete as a financial advisor at Redstone Capital Management.  Jacquie's high-performance mentality now manifests itself more as a financial coach to young, affluent professionals who are striving to establish life and financial goals, as well as a plan to realize these goals.  Because of her understanding of what it takes to succeed as a young woman in highly competitive endeavors, Jacquie is uniquely qualified to work with ambitious and successful women and female athletes in areas of financial literacy, goal setting, and wealth accumulation.

She prides herself on encouraging her clients to approach investing and wealth planning as a learning opportunity.  She believes in the empowerment which comes from developing a personal relationship with a trusted advisor, frequent communications, and a truly bespoke approach to personal wealth management.
